          <li>Advisor program built for the FDNY (Fire Department of New York)</li>
          <li>Advises the FDNY based on a received call and produces actions to take, units to send, and expected incident duration based on trained information</li>

      <h3><strong>Multi-threaded Map Reduce Shuffle</strong></h3>
      <div class = "bulletandphoto">
        <ul>
          <li>N-Gram - a sequence of exactly n words in some single sentence, and not spanning across punctuation characters</li>
          <li>A multi threaded program that scans a folder of txt files and outputs the top 5 most frequently found N-Grams of each thread</li>
          <li>Avoids threads having the same phrases in their outputs by using string hashing and mapping
            <ul>
              <li>Mapping step: Compute the n-grams for each of the files the particular thread is assigned to. The result of these steps will be that each thread has a collection of (key-value) objects where the key is a hashed integer identifying the n-gram, and the value is the associated frequency count of word sequences of size n that this thread computed.</li>
              <li>Shuffling step: After each thread builds and counts its n-gram collection, each thread will send their n-grams to a bucket depending on the string hash value (# of buckets = # of threads). N-Gram shuffling implemented via locking mechanisms on each bucket to ensure no loss of data</li>
              <li>Reduce step: Upon completion of sending hashed strings to their buckets, each thread will then reduce by summing the counts for each n-gram it recieved, combining frequencys for n-grams with the same hash key. Finally, The program will then output the top 5 frequency counts for each thread</li>
